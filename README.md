A simple tool to run JSX directly in the browser! This means we can now use it on any static sites, SPAs, or server-side languages like PHP and Node.js. 

> This project started as a fun learning journey, and Iâ€™m excited to open it up to the community. Your feedback and comments are highly appreciated. If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, feel free to fork the repo, make changes, test, and create a pull request. Letâ€™s innovate and learn together! ðŸ’¡ðŸ”§

## How it works?
The process behind this transpiler is straightforward and easy to understand. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:
- **Extracting Code**: The transpiler extracts all the JavaScript and HTML code from the JSX file.
- **Injecting JavaScript**: It then places the JavaScript code into the header of the DOM.
- **Rendering HTML**: Finally, it loads the HTML content into the specified element on the page.

I highly encourage you to give it a try to see how it works in action.

## Dependencies and Styling
This project leverages [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) for styling and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to demonstrate JSX elements in action within the browser. Here's a brief overview of these dependencies:

- **Bootstrap CSS**: Iâ€™ve used Bootstrap for its powerful and responsive CSS framework, which simplifies styling and ensures a clean, modern look for the application.
- **JSONPlaceholder**: To showcase the functionality of JSX elements, Iâ€™ve integrated JSONPlaceholder, a free online REST API, to fetch and display dynamic content in the browser.
By combining Bootstrap CSS and JSONPlaceholder, the project not only demonstrates how to run JSX directly in the browser but also provides a visually appealing and interactive experience.
